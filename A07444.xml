            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Neither can you ſay, that ſuch a one is ſimply perplexed, becauſe he had a way to auoyd it, <hi>By depoſing his erronious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> which if he doth not, he is perplexed by his owne fault: and if he be not able to iudge of ſuch things by himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ignorance, he muſt conſult with the learned and godly: So that, <hi>An erronious Conſcience bindeth,</hi> but not as a right Conſcience; for it bindeth not to doe that, which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth contrary to Gods law, though it beleeue it doth all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, for then it ſhould binde againſt the law, and conſequently a man ſhould be bound to doe againſt the law, when as the law bindeth to the performance of it; So that a man ſhould be bound at the ſelfe ſame time, <hi>Ad oppoſita incompoſſibilia,</hi> two contraries, which cannot ſtand together, which is a groſſe abſurdity.</p>

Therefore an <hi>Erroneous Conſcience is bound to depoſe his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> not by the bond of Conſcience, which doth imitate this, becauſe it is thought not to erre, but by the bond of <hi>Gods Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> which ſaith; <hi>Ne demoreris in errore;</hi> Abide not thou in <note place="margin">Eccluſſ. 17.</note> thine error.</p>

               <p>They ſay, it ſtandeth not with the goodneſſe of God, to be cruell againſt his creatures, and that hee ſhould ſuffer any of thoſe whom he hath made, to periſh; And thus while they thinke, <hi>They honour his goodneſſe, they offend his Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence they conclude, that the immenſity of Gods mercy and goodneſſe is ſuch, that he will ſaue euery man in his owne faith, law, ſect, or religion, if ſo be he beleeue the ſame to be good and pleaſing vnto God.</p>
               <p>They argue farther; That it is a great preſumption to ſuppoſe, that a fewe Chriſtians, ſhould thinke themſelues only to be ſaued, the whole remaining multitude of euill <hi>Christians,</hi> which farre exceede the good in number, beſide <hi>Iewes, Saracens,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> being caſt off to deſtruction; Doth it ſtand with Gods Maieſtie who is Lord of heauen and earth, to haue moe ſlaues then freemen; more adiudged to

               <p>It is certaine, that hee created them out of the riches of his goodneſſe, and beſtowed many great guifts on them freely; But hee neuer puniſhed any without their moſt iuſt deſert: Whence it appeareth, that the Iuſtice of God, is the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of their damnation; but their owne euill deſerts are (as it were) the <hi>materiall</hi> and meritorious cauſe of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>But that there are ſo many damned, and ſo few which are, and ſhall be ſaued; is cauſed partly by the Iuſtice of God, partly through want of diſpoſition in Man, to receiue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine Gods mercy.</p>
